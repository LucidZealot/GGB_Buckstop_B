Local Solution Deployment
Prerequisites:
Docker Desktop
.NET 6 SDK *might be only necessary for development did not test
Git

1. Clone the repository (done through Git CMD):
git clone https://github.com/ZealousKyng/GGB_Buckstop.git
cd GGB_Buckstop
2. Start all services using Docker Compose (requires Docker Desktop running):
docker-compose up
3. Access the application:
* Webapp: http://localhost:8080/
* API Gateway: http://localhost:8081/
* Snake: http://localhost:8082/
* Pong: http://localhost:8083/
* Tetris: http://localhost:8084/
Only the Webapp seems to load properly while others 404 when trying to access directly but games are accessible through Webapp just fine.
Following these steps should set up a local instance with containers.
